DiscordWrecker: Two python scripts that can be used to cause chaos in discord servers.

Installation should be pretty easy if you have python already installed. If not, DOWNLOAD IT BEFORE USING THIS!


Setup:

Run "cd discord-wrecker" in CMD or Terminal.
Then, run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Now, open innocent.py and destroyer.py in an IDE or a text editor, like Notepad.
Enter the desired discord token into the token = "" field on both files and save.
(If you do not know how to get your discord token, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI).

Done!

Run InnocentBot:
- python innocent.py

Run Destroyer:
- python destroyer.py
